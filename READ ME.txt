PATATAP Game

Patatap game needs howler.js and paper.js frameworks to make it work. The source code is provided for you. This is a good example to see how howler.js library is being used in simple applications. You can make your own music and use different shapes with different animations.

You can follow the explanation on this link: https://shahsparx.me/paper-js-howler-js-example/

Paper.js framework has its own visual methods. These methods are not easy to read. I recommend you to not to use it. But it is a good source for inspiration. Press keyboard buttons to interact with the application.

BREAKOUT Game

It is the same game from the Christmas break. I have just added sound on it. Just a few people completed the Breakout game. So, maybe you would like to do it now and add some sound as well. Create your own Breakout game.

MUSIC PLAYER Game

I have created this one for you. It has a lot of room for improvement. You may just use this game as a base and improve/change it. You can make the falling balls random in the other columns. Make them asynchronous. Also you can change the the visuals.

You can just modify all these examples or just see them as an inspiration. Come up with your own game idea and develop your game.

I understand that you may think all these game homework are trivial. But actually you are learning a lot this way. These are basic peace of softwares that you should be able to program not specifically as a game programmer but as a ‘programmer’ in any field.

How to play: Use ‘ A-S-D-F-G ’ buttons as the control buttons in a row assigned to the circles from left to right. So, A=Yellow,
S=Green,
D=Blue,
F=Purple,
G=Red

You should press the right button when the matching color is on the control circle. If you press it right time, you will hear a sound assigned to that color.

The most important part: Use your creativity and have fun!

P.S: Place an ‘easter egg’ to your application:)  If you find my easter egg in MusicPlayer game I am gonna know it:)) A surprise is waiting for you!
